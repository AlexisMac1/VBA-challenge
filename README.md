# Stock Analysis VBA Program

This VBA program analyzes stock data stored in Excel worksheets. It calculates the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock ticker symbol. Additionally, it identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume. The program applies conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red for the yearly change column.

To use the program, I opened the Excel file containing the stock data, enable macros if prompted, and run the VBA macro named `StockAnalysis`. The stock data is organized in sheets by year, with columns representing `<ticker> <date> <open> <high> <low> <close> <vol>`. The analyzed data will be populated in the specified columns, and the stocks with the greatest changes and total volume will be displayed in rows 2 to 4.

Dependencies: Microsoft Excel with macros enabled.
